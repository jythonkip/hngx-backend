Create and host an endpoint using any programming language of your choice.
The endpoint should take two GET request query parameters and return specific information in JSON format.

## Requirements 📚

The information required includes Slack name
Current day of the week Current UTC (with validation of +/-2)
Track
The GitHub URL of the file being run
The GitHub URL of the full source code.
A Status Code of Success

```json
{
  "slack_name": "example_name",
  "current_day": "Monday",
  "utc_time": "2023-08-21T15:04:05Z",
  "track": "backend",
  "github_file_url": "https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/file_name.ext",
  "github_repo_url": "https://github.com/username/repo",
  "status_code": 200
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✍️

1. **Endpoint Creation**: Provide a publicly accessible endpoint.
2. **GET Parameters**: The endpoint should accept two GET request query parameters: slack_name and track.

   Track: The response should display the track of the you signed up for (Backend). This will be based on the track GET parameter passed to the endpoint.
6. **GitHub File URL**: Include a direct link to the specific file in the GitHub repository that's being executed.
7. **GitHub Repo URL**: Include a link to the main page of the GitHub repository containing the project's entire source code.
8. **Status Code**: Return 200 as Integer.
9. **JSON Format**: The endpoint's response should adhere to the specified JSON format.
   Testing: Before submission:
   Ensure the endpoint is accessible.
   Check the returned JSON against the defined format.
